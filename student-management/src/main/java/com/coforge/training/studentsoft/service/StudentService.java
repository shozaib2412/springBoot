* The Service Layer in Spring Boot is a crucial concept in Java-based applications. 
 * It acts as an interface between the Controller and Repository layers, 
 * handling business logic and encapsulating complex functionalities. 
 * A Service layer typically contains classes that interact with the Repository 
 * to retrieve or update data, and with the Controller to handle HTTP requests 
 * and responses. 
 * It's responsible for coordinating the flow of data and ensuring data consistency 
 * across the application. 
 * 
 * In Spring Boot, you can create services by annotating classes with @Service and 
 * using autowiring to inject dependencies.
 * The @Service annotation in Spring Boot is a stereotype annotation that 
 * marks a class as a service provider. 
 * It is used to indicate that a class contains business logic.
 * It organize and manage business logic in your Spring Boot application.
